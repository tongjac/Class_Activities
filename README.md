# Class Activities and Exercises in the Futility of Dogkind

- Folders will be organized in chronological order based on which Week each subject was covered. Recent commits are personal revisits to projects and practice pages occuring within.

- Much of this classwork is open source and shared with my peers, and I will do my best to cite projects that involved peer input.

- Many an attempt has been made to get each project functional and organized. Please make and break all assets and files in this repository as you see fit!
